# INTEGRATION TASK: Competitor Intelligence Agent

OBJECTIVE:
Integrate the Competitor Intelligence Agent system into our existing project, maintaining its multi-agent architecture while adapting it to our needs.

CURRENT COMPONENTS:
- Competitor Intelligence Agent with multiple specialized agents (Firecrawl, Exa, Analysis, Comparison)
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek)
- Streamlit-based UI

INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. Code Structure:
   - Maintain the agent-based architecture
   - Preserve support for multiple LLM providers
   - Adapt the Streamlit UI to match our application's style
   - Ensure proper error handling and API key management

2. Key Features to Preserve:
   - Multi-agent coordination system
   - Competitor discovery and analysis
   - Flexible LLM provider selection
   - Structured analysis reports

3. Modifications Needed:
   - Convert Streamlit UI to match our application's frontend
   - Integrate with our existing authentication system
   - Add proper logging and monitoring
   - Implement our standard error handling patterns

4. API Integration Points:
   - Connect to our existing API key management
   - Integrate with our data storage system
   - Add proper rate limiting and caching
   - Implement our standard API response formats

Please analyze the codebase and:
1. Create necessary integration classes/modules
2. Adapt the CompetitorIntelligenceTeam class to our system
3. Implement proper error handling and logging
4. Add appropriate tests
5. Update documentation

Focus on maintaining the core functionality while making it seamlessly work within our existing architecture.
