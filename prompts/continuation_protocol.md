# MANDATORY CONTINUATION PROTOCOL
Version: 2.0

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

1. CONTEXT PRESERVATION & OPTIMIZATION
   YOU MUST capture and optimize:
   - ALL active file states (40% token priority)
   - COMPLETE task progress (30% token priority)
   - CRITICAL dependencies (20% token priority)
   - ESSENTIAL error states (10% token priority)

2. STATE SERIALIZATION
   YOU SHALL generate an AIF document containing:
   ```json
   {
     "metadata": {
       "contextFingerprint": "[HASH]",
       "taskProgress": "PERCENTAGE",
       "modeState": "CURRENT_RIPER_MODE",
       "timestamp": "ISO_TIMESTAMP"
     },
     "preservedContext": {
       "activeFiles": [],
       "decisions": [],
       "pendingActions": [],
       "errorStates": []
     },
     "continuationInstructions": {
       "nextActions": [],
       "criticalConstraints": [],
       "userPreferences": []
     }
   }
   ```

3. EXECUTION MANDATE
   YOU MUST:
   - Review ALL previous tasks in conversation
   - Complete ANY unfinished implementations
   - Execute ALL pending steps without pausing
   - Continue through action thresholds automatically

4. QUALITY ASSURANCE
   YOU MUST verify and resolve:
   - ALL runtime errors
   - ALL edge cases
   - ALL linting issues
   - ALL compatibility issues

   On error detection, YOU SHALL:
   - Implement immediate fixes
   - Verify fix effectiveness
   - Document resolution
   - Continue to next issue

## CONTINUATION REQUIREMENTS

YOU SHALL ensure:
1. Zero context loss during transition
2. Complete task state preservation
3. Seamless workflow continuation
4. Perfect preference retention

## VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

YOU MUST verify:
1. Context checksum matches
2. State serialization integrity
3. Token optimization success
4. Transition marker placement

YOU SHALL NOT:
- Request approval for any action
- Pause between task completions
- Skip or defer any requirements
- Stop until ALL issues are resolved

## EXECUTION DIRECTIVE

1. Generate continuation prompt
2. Verify AIF integrity
3. Initiate state transfer
4. Confirm successful transition

PROCEED WITH CONTINUATION SEQUENCE IMMEDIATELY.....
