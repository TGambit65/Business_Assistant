# SpellChecker Service Test Failures Analysis

## Current Test Failures

1. Dictionary Loading Retry Test:
```typescript
// Test failing with:
Expected: 3
Received: 0
```

2. Multi-language Test Timeout:
```typescript
// Test failing with:
thrown: "Exceeded timeout of 5000 ms for a test"
```

## Key Implementation Files

1. `src/spellchecker/spell-checker-service.ts`:
- Contains main service implementation
- Handles dictionary loading and retry logic
- Manages initialization state

2. `src/spellchecker/dictionary-utils.ts`:
- Handles dictionary file loading
- Implements retry mechanism
- Provides fallback dictionary creation

3. `src/spellchecker/tests/spell-checker-service.test.ts`:
- Contains test suite
- Mocks dictionary loading
- Verifies retry behavior

## Critical Questions

1. For Retry Count Test:
- How is the retry count being tracked?
- Where should retry counting occur - in service or utils?
- How to properly expose retry attempts for testing?

2. For Timeout Issues:
- Are dictionary operations properly mocked?
- Is there async cleanup happening?
- Are we properly handling Promise chains?

## Required Solution Format

Please provide:

1. Modified test implementation showing:
   - Proper retry count tracking
   - Correct async/await usage
   - Proper test cleanup

2. Updated service code showing:
   - Retry mechanism implementation
   - Timeout handling
   - Resource cleanup

3. Verification steps to ensure:
   - Retry count is accurate
   - Tests complete within timeout
   - Resources are properly cleaned up

Note: Focus on actual implementation rather than theoretical solutions.
