## Key UI Improvement Areas

The following areas require significant improvement:

### 1. Theme System
Currently, the application lacks a proper theme system. We need:
- A new page in Settings for theme management
- Interface for selecting existing themes
- Functionality for uploading custom themes
- A "Create Theme" page with information about the upcoming theme editor

### 2. Navigation
The top navigation has several issues:
- Low visibility and poor contrast
- Missing dropdown menu for Overview and Analytics
- Unclear visual hierarchy
- Inconsistent styling

### 3. Visual Design
Overall visual design needs improvement:
- Better contrast and readability
- More distinct UI components
- Improved spacing and layout
- Consistent visual language throughout the application
