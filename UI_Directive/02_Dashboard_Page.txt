## UI Issues
- Default theme is light theme unless dark mode is selected and saved in database
- Top navigation bar lacks clear structure and hierarchy
- Main navigation elements (sidebar) have minimal visual styling and are transparent MUST be visible and on top
- Limited visual distinction between different priority levels
- Missing dropdown to access overview and analytics (as mentioned in requirements)
- Icons appear small and lack visual impact
- Dark theme implementation creates visibility challenges in some areas and should be earth tones in colors
- Light theme implementation creates visibility challenges in some areas and should be white background in color
- "Install App" button placement seems inconsistent
- Limited use of color to create visual hierarchy and differentiate between different priority levels
- "Install App" button placement seems inconsistent and could be improved
