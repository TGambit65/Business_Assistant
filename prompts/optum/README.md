# AI Assistant Optimization Framework Prompts

This directory contains specialized prompts for implementing each component of the AI Assistant Optimization Framework. Each prompt is designed to be token-efficient while providing comprehensive guidance for implementation.

## Organization

The framework implementation is divided into five key areas, each with its own dedicated prompt:

1. **[Technical Components](./01_technical_components.md)** - Core infrastructure including token allocation manager, AIF format, and benchmark runner
2. **[Optimization Strategies](./02_optimization_strategies.md)** - Advanced techniques for context management, dynamic thresholds, and compression
3. **[Cross-Assistant Capabilities](./03_cross_assistant_capabilities.md)** - Integration with RIPER modes, specialized agents, and workflow orchestration
4. **[User Experience Layer](./04_user_experience_layer.md)** - Transparent interfaces, complexity detection, and assistant selection
5. **[Evaluation Methodology](./05_evaluation_methodology.md)** - Testing framework, metrics collection, and visualization

## Implementation Order

These components have dependencies on each other and should ideally be implemented in the following sequence:

1. Begin with the **Technical Components** to establish the core infrastructure
2. Implement **Evaluation Methodology** next to enable testing of subsequent components
3. Develop **Optimization Strategies** leveraging the core infrastructure
4. Create **Cross-Assistant Capabilities** to enable multi-agent workflows
5. Finally, build the **User Experience Layer** to make the system accessible to users

## Integration with Email Assistant

This optimization framework complements the recent removal of TinyMCE from the Email Assistant project. With TinyMCE successfully replaced by Draft.js, the application is now more maintainable and has fewer external dependencies.

The optimization framework will further enhance the application by:

- Improving performance through efficient token usage
- Enabling integration with specialized assistants for different tasks
- Providing better user control over AI system behavior
- Establishing metrics to track and improve AI assistant performance

## Next Steps

To begin implementation, start with [01_technical_components.md](./01_technical_components.md) and use the token allocation manager as the first component to develop, as it forms the foundation for the other optimization techniques.
