# Roo Code Project-Optimized Prompts

This directory contains automatically generated prompt templates optimized for this specific project.

## Purpose

These templates are designed to:

1. **Maximize Roo Code's effectiveness** by providing project-specific context
2. **Optimize token usage** through targeted context thresholds
3. **Standardize tool usage patterns** based on your codebase
4. **Apply best practices** specific to your technology stack
5. **Reduce errors** by highlighting common pitfalls

## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Select the appropriate prompt** for your current task
2. **Copy the content between the triple backticks**
3. **Customize the placeholders** (task complexity, description)
4. **Paste at the start of your conversation** with Roo Code

## Available Prompts

- `general_tasks.md` - Everyday development tasks
- `bug_fixing.md` - Debugging and issue resolution
- `feature_development.md` - Implementing new functionality
- `testing_tasks.md` - Creating and maintaining tests
- `reanalysis.md` - Triggering project reanalysis

## Keeping Prompts Updated

Your codebase will evolve over time. To ensure these prompts remain relevant:

1. Use the `reanalysis.md` prompt when:
   - Adding new technologies or frameworks
   - Making significant architectural changes
   - Every 2-3 months during active development

2. Roo Code will:
   - Analyze your current project structure
   - Update all prompt templates
   - Add new templates if needed
   - Preserve any customizations

## Custom Additions

Feel free to add your own sections to these prompts. When reanalysis occurs, Roo Code will
preserve these customizations while updating the technical details.

## Benefits of Using These Prompts

- **Faster results** through better context management
- **More accurate code** that follows your project patterns
- **Less back-and-forth** as Roo understands your needs faster
- **Consistent approach** across your development team
- **Higher-quality output** tailored to your specific tech stack
