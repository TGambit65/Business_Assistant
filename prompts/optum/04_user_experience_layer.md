# AI Assistant Optimization: Integrating User Experience Layer

## Task Overview
Develop a user experience layer that makes optimization techniques transparent, accessible, and adaptable to user needs. This layer will enable users to understand and control how AI assistants optimize for their specific tasks and preferences.

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. Transparent Optimization Selection UI
Create user interface components that allow visibility and control over optimization strategies:

- **Strategy Visualization**: Design interfaces that visually represent current optimization settings
- **Customization Controls**: Build intuitive controls for adjusting optimization parameters
- **Optimization Presets**: Create task-specific presets that users can apply with a single action
- **Feedback Indicators**: Develop real-time indicators showing the effects of optimization choices
- **Educational Elements**: Design tooltips and guidance that explain optimization concepts

### 2. Task Complexity Detection
Implement systems that automatically assess task complexity and suggest appropriate optimization approaches:

- **Input Analysis**: Build mechanisms to analyze input text for complexity indicators
- **Context Size Estimation**: Create algorithms that predict token requirements based on task type
- **Multi-step Detection**: Develop methods to identify tasks requiring sequential processing
- **Domain Recognition**: Implement classification of task domains (coding, creative, analytical, etc.)
- **Resource Requirement Prediction**: Build models that estimate computational needs of different tasks

### 3. Assistant Selection Automation
Create systems that intelligently select and configure the appropriate assistant for specific tasks:

- **Task-Assistant Matching**: Develop algorithms that map task characteristics to assistant capabilities
- **Capability Detection**: Build mechanisms to identify required assistant capabilities for a task
- **Performance History Analysis**: Create systems that learn from past assistant performance
- **Dynamic Switching**: Implement smooth transitions between different assistants during workflows
- **Preference Learning**: Build adaptive systems that remember user preferences for assistant selection

## Implementation Guidelines
- Prioritize intuitive, non-technical user interfaces
- Design for progressive disclosure of advanced options
- Ensure rapid feedback cycles for optimization adjustments
- Focus on teaching users about optimization through interaction
- Build systems that improve with continued use
