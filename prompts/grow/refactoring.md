# Refactoring Prompt Template

**Tech Stack:** [Auto-Detected Stack Placeholder]
**Project Complexity:** [Auto-Detected Complexity Placeholder] (Context Threshold: [Threshold Placeholder]%)

## Refactoring Goal

[Placeholder for refactoring objective: e.g., improve readability of X, extract Y into a reusable component, simplify Z logic]
**Constraint:** Do not change external behavior or functionality.

## Context Requirements

- Provide file path(s) for the code to be refactored:
    - [Source File Path 1 Placeholder]
    - [Source File Path 2 Placeholder] (if applicable)
- Include code snippets for:
    - The specific code block(s) to be refactored
    - Any calling code that might be affected by internal changes (e.g., method signatures)

## Tool Usage Suggestions

- Use `read_file` extensively to understand the code and its context.
- Use `apply_diff` for precise changes within existing files.
- Use `write_to_file` if extracting code to new files/modules.
- Use `search_files` to find all usages of the code being refactored to ensure consistency.
- Use `execute_command` to run tests frequently (`npm test`) to verify behavior hasn't changed.
