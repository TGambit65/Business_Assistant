# Email assistant configuration

# ===== IMPORTANT: DEEPSEEK API SETUP =====
# To use the AI Chat assistant, you need to:
# 1. Sign up at https://platform.deepseek.ai/ or https://console.deepseek.com/
# 2. Create an API key under your account
# 3. Copy your API key and paste it below
# 4. Rename this file from .env.example to .env

# You only need ONE of these keys (in order of preference)
REACT_APP_DEEPSEEK_R1_KEY=your-r1-key-here         # Best option: R1 compatible key
REACT_APP_DEEPSEEK_V3_KEY=your-v3-key-here         # Second option: V3 compatible key
REACT_APP_DEEPSEEK_KEY=your-fallback-key-here      # Alternative
REACT_APP_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-other-key-here     # Alternative

# ===== DEMO MODE =====
# Set to 'true' to use local responses without API calls (for development/testing)
# This is useful when you don't have an API key or want to test UI without API calls
REACT_APP_USE_DEMO_MODE=false

# ===== TROUBLESHOOTING =====
# If you're having issues with the API:
# - Ensure your API key is correctly copied (no extra spaces)
# - Check your account has sufficient credits
# - The application will try both api.deepseek.ai and api.deepseek.com endpoints
# - For development, you can leave keys empty and use fallback responses

# ===== ADVANCED CONFIGURATION =====
# The service will automatically try these endpoints:
# - https://api.deepseek.ai/v1  (primary)
# - https://api.deepseek.com/v1 (fallback)
# 
# The service will try these models in sequence:
# - deepseek-chat         (works with R1 keys)
# - deepseek-chat-v1      (works with V3 keys)
# - deepseek-coder        (fallback)
# - deepseek-coder-instruct (final fallback)

# API Endpoints
# - https://api.deepseek.ai/v1
# - https://api.deepseek.com/v1 
# We're using both https://api.deepseek.ai/v1 and https://api.deepseek.com/v1 endpoints

# Add more configuration options as needed
