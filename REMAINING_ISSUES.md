# Remaining Issues Report (2025-04-01)

This document outlines the known issues remaining after the recent cleanup and refactoring tasks.

## 1. Potential TypeScript Errors in Test Files

- **Issue:** The initial test run indicated 14 failing test suites. While specific errors in `pwa.test.ts`, `DraftGenerator.test.tsx`, and `TextArea.test.tsx` related to `getByPlaceholder` have been addressed, other test files might still contain similar errors or other TypeScript issues.
- **Context:** Error `e1` from preserved context.
- **Next Step:** Run the full frontend test suite (`cd frontend && npm test`) to identify and fix any remaining test failures.

## 2. Type Errors in Mocks/Config

- **Issue:** Type errors were previously identified in `frontend/src/services/deepseek/deepseek.mock.ts` and potentially related configuration files like `SpellCheckerConfig`.
- **Context:** Error `e3` from preserved context.
- **Next Step:** Investigate and resolve the type errors in these specific files.

## 3. Placeholder Security Modules

- **Issue:** Several security module files were created as empty placeholders in `src/security/` to resolve import errors in `src/security/index.ts`. These modules lack implementation.
- **Files Created:**
    - `src/security/KeyVault.ts`
    - `src/security/AnalyticsEncryption.ts`
    - `src/security/EncryptionService.ts`
    - `src/security/SecurityConfig.ts`
    - `src/security/SecurityUtils.ts`
    - `src/security/SecurityConstants.ts`
    - `src/security/SecurityTypes.ts`
    - `src/security/SecurityValidation.ts`
    - `src/security/SecurityLogger.ts`
    - `src/security/SecurityMetrics.ts`
    - `src/security/SecurityMonitor.ts`
- **Context:** Addressing error `e2` from preserved context.
- **Next Step:** Implement the required functionality within these security modules based on project requirements.
